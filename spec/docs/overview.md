# Overview

## What This Repository Is

`awesome-web-scraping` is a curated "awesome list" of web-scraping resources:
software packages, services, and manuals. Each resource is listed as a single
markdown list entry with a link, a brief one-line description, and nothing more.
The list is organized by programming language and tool category.

## Content Policy

This is a curated list, not a directory dump. Contributions are subject to
restrictions; the authoritative rules live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. In short, the
following are not accepted:

- Web services / websites / remote APIs — anything that is not standalone software
- Anything related to automation with an AI agent or the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Contributions are made via pull requests. New entries are appended to the end
of the relevant list; they are never inserted into the middle of a list.

## Repository Layout

  Captcha Solving Services, Proxy Server Marketplaces, Telegram Discussion

  agent workflow, contribution workflow

  scripts

## How the List Is Organized

- The README's Topics section links to each language/domain list file.
- Every list file is self-contained: its own title, introduction, table of
  contents, and sections.
- The Python list is the largest and most granular; other language lists follow
  the same general structure with fewer, flatter sections.
- Each file ends with a section linking to related curated lists for that language.
